# Torque_hackathon_project
This is a Jee Study Portal called Torque
Our project, "Torque," is a perfect fit for the open track as it addresses one of the most critical challenges students face: education. The highlight of our website is the Relevancy Meter, which leverages AI to evaluate the relevance of questions based on the concepts involved. It provides a relevancy percentage by analyzing years of question paper data.

Additionally, our platform includes several key features:

A timer, which helps students track their study sessions and manage their time effectively.
A leaderboard, fostering healthy competition among students.
A curated list of important chapters and books, providing students with essential resources for their preparation.
These features work together to create a comprehensive, data-driven study platform that enhances learning efficiency and success.
